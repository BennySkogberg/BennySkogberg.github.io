# Configuring and Coding

I find myself trapped between desicions on weather or not to develop a feature. Usually, I go a long way trying to configure a feature rather than coding it. It's not because I think coding is bad, but because the framework we rely on sometimes make changes. These changes can, if one is unfortunate, break the code. So if I'm given a choice, I configure before I code.

## Why do you "use" Git?

As of now, I'm only figuring out how the tool works, before I do any real damage :) This page is created using the guide [Getting Started with GitHub Pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/), and it's great fun!
